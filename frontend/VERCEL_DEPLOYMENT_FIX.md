# ðŸš€ Vercel Deployment Fix

## âœ… **Build Error Fixed**

The build error was caused by environment variable validation running during build time. This has been fixed in `src/lib/config.ts`.

## ðŸ›  **Required Vercel Environment Variables**

Set these in **Vercel Dashboard â†’ Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables**:

```bash
# Required - Your Railway backend URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app

# Optional - App configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV=production
```

## ðŸ”§ **How to Find Your Railway Backend URL**

1. **Railway Dashboard** â†’ Your backend service
2. **Settings** â†’ **Networking** â†’ **Public Domain**
3. Copy the URL (e.g., `https://coffee-scheduler-backend-production-abc123.up.railway.app`)
4. Use this as your `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel

## ðŸ“‹ **Deployment Checklist**

### **Backend (Railway)** âœ… COMPLETE
- âœ… Backend deployed and running on Railway
- âœ… MongoDB connected successfully 
- âœ… Running on port 8080 (Railway auto-assigns this)
- âœ… Environment: production

### **Frontend (Vercel)** - Complete these steps:
1. **Set Environment Variable**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = Your Railway backend URL
2. **Deploy**: Push to main branch or redeploy
3. **Test**: Visit your Vercel URL and test the app

## ðŸ§ª **Testing Your Deployment**

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
```bash
# Test your Railway backend
curl https://your-backend-service.up.railway.app/api/health

# Test your Vercel frontend
# Visit your Vercel URL in browser - should load without errors
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**

1. **Add Railway URL to Vercel**:
   - Copy your Railway backend URL 
   - Add as `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel environment variables
   - Redeploy frontend
